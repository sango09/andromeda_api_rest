## Andromeda API REST

To start working on this project I highly recommend you to check
[pydanny's](https://github.com/pydanny) [Django Cookiecutter](https://github.com/pydanny/cookiecutter-django) [documentation](https://cookiecutter-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developing-locally-docker.html) on how to get this project up and running locally.
If you don't want to do so, just run:

```bash
docker-compose -f local.yml build
docker-compose -f local.yml up
```
